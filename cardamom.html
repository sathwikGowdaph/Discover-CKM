        <h3>Cardamom</h3>
        <p>In the Chikkamagaluru district, green cardamom is the dominant type, with the Malabar cultivar being widely grown in Karnataka due to its suitability for the region's conditions. While black cardamom also exists, it is less prominent. Within green
            cardamom, there are various grades like Bold and Super Bold, referring to the size and quality of the pods, and also specific cultivated types such as the Coorg green variety, known for its distinct aroma. </p>
