        <h3>Areca Nut</h3>
        <p>While the district is a major areca nut cultivation region, specific "types" are usually named after the variety of the areca plant or its processing. Common varieties include Mangala, Sumangala, Sarvamangala, and Tirthahalli, and the nuts are
            processed into forms like raw (for chewing), boiled (red variety), or dried (white variety). The quality of the nut depends on the variety and processing method.
